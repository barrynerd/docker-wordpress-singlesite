# --- Future WooCommerce Configuration Goes Here ---
# This is where you would add commands to:
# 1. Update general WooCommerce store options (e.g., currency, store address).
# 2. Configure tax rates (potentially via CSV import or direct wp option update).
# 3. Set up default shipping zones or payment gateways.
# 4. Any other baseline WooCommerce settings you want to automate.
